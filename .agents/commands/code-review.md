# Code Review
> PR review mode adapted from PRPs-agentic-eng by Wirasm. Part of the PRP workflow series.

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Mode Selection
If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a PR number, PR URL, or `--pr`:
→ Jump to **PR Review Mode** below.

Otherwise:
→ Use **Local Review Mode**.

---

## Local Review Mode
Comprehensive security and quality review of uncommitted changes.

### Phase 1 — GATHER
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

If no changed files, stop: "Nothing to review."

### Phase 2 — REVIEW
Read each changed file in full. Check for:

**Security Issues (CRITICAL):**
- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Missing input validation
- Insecure dependencies
- Path traversal risks

**Code Quality (HIGH):**
- Functions > 50 lines
- Files > 800 lines
- Nesting depth > 4 levels
- Missing error handling
- console.log statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Missing JSDoc for public APIs

**Best Practices (MEDIUM):**
- Mutation patterns (use immutable instead)
- Emoji usage in code/comments
- Missing tests for new code
- Accessibility issues (a11y)

### Phase 3 — REPORT
Generate report with:
- Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- File location and line numbers
- Issue description
- Suggested fix

Block commit if CRITICAL or HIGH issues found.
Never approve code with security vulnerabilities.

## PR Review Mode
Comprehensive GitHub PR review — fetches diff, reads full files, runs validation, posts review.

### Phase 1 — FETCH
Parse input to determine PR:

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Number (e.g. `42`) | Use as PR number |
| URL (`github.com/.../pull/42`) | Extract PR number |
| Branch name | Find PR via `gh pr list --head <branch>` |

```bash
gh pr view <NUMBER> --json number,title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,changedFiles,additions,deletions
gh pr diff <NUMBER>
```

If PR not found, stop with error. Store PR metadata for later phases.

### Phase 2 — CONTEXT
Build review context:
1. **Project rules** — Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/docs/`, and any contributing guidelines
2. **PRP artifacts** — Check `.claude/PRPs/reports/` and `.claude/PRPs/plans/` for implementation context related to this PR
3. **PR intent** — Parse PR description for goals, linked issues, test plans
4. **Changed files** — List all modified files and categorize by type (source, test, config, docs)

### Phase 3 — REVIEW
Read each changed file in full (not just the diff hunks — you need surrounding context).

## Edge Cases
- **No `gh` CLI**: Fall back to local-only review (read the diff, skip GitHub publish). Warn user.
